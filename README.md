# Is The Playing Field Level?

# Background

This project compares the distribution of rankings of top high school football players to the distribution of income across the U.S.

The goal was to see if wealthier recruits (who were more likely to afford private coaching) tended to recieve more top ratings and premier college scholarship offers, which in turn could increase the probability of making it in the NFL.
