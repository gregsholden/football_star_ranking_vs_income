# Is The Playing Field Level?

# Background

This project compares the distribution of rankings of top high school football players to the distribution of income across the U.S.

Top high school football players are given star rankings by recruiting servies.  These range from 1 to 5 stars, where 5 star prospects are the highest ranked.  Approzimately 1% of the 3300 recruits ranked annually receive a 5-star ranking, while the next ~10% receive a 4-star ranking.  U.S. college football programs pay close attention to these rankings, and try to recruit as many highly-ranked players as possible.

The goal of this project was to see if wealthier recruits (who are more likely to be able to afford private camps and coaching) tended to recieve a disproportional share of top raankings.  If so this could lead to more scholarship offers from prestigious college football programs.  This could then lead to a greater chance of making it to the NFL, where player contracts can be extremely lucrative.
